# Midterm

## Goal

* What we hope to learn from the modeling effort

## Justification

* e.g., Somebody else has done something and I want to extent/ improve it

## Background

## Technical Approach

<!--
To "navigate" the unstructured domain knowledge about a complex system, write down ~5 sentences about the most important dynamics, then highlight the nouns and the verbs. Think about the relationships between subjects and direct objects in these statements.

Layout?
    -- 2D physical space or network?
    -- von Neumann neighborhoods (Rook's rule; Manhattan distance) or Moore neighborhoods (Queen's rule; Chebyshev distance)?

Boundary conditions?
    Are they reflective, do they permit things to leave the system?

Agents:

    Households
        Properties:
        -- Number of people
        -- Income level | No. of people
        -- Job security | Income, No. of people
        Actions:
        -- Move within neighborhood (no cost)
        -- Move to another neighborhood (cost)
        -- Move outside of city; exit simulation (cost)

Model parameters/ configuration?
    -- Under what conditions will a model instance be run?
    -- What is the parameter space we will sweep?
