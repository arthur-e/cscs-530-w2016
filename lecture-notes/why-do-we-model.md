# Why do we model?

## What are models?
  * Let's try a few definitions.  Models are: ...
    * ... wrong, but hopefully useful.
	* ... sets of nouns and verbs that define a framework for statements and computation (semantics and syntax)
	* ... "simplified descriptions, especially mathematical ones, of a system or process, to assist calculations and predictions."
    * ... "composition of concepts, which are used to help people know, understand, or simulate a subject the model represents."
	* ... "a description of a system using mathematical concepts and language."
  * A comprehensive list of adjectives in academic text:
    * **BYU Corpus of Contemporary English**: http://corpus.byu.edu/coca/
	  * Word(s): [model]
	  * Collocates: [j*] 1 0
	  * Sections: Academic
	* **Results**: Theoretical, Conceptual, Linear, Economic, Standard, Medical, Structural, Mathematical, Instructional, Mental, Statistical, Multivariate, Predictive, Cognitive, Hierarchical, Simple, Unconditional, Computational, Causal, Hypothesized, Mixed, Logistic, Null, Complex, Dynamic, Analytical, Multidimensional, Social, Experimental

## Why have we modeled historically?
  * We can view modeling through two approaches to philosophy of science
     * Popper
	   * Problems are identified 
	   * Conjecture generates theory to address problems
	   * Theory generates theoretical models
	   * Theoretical models generate testable statements
	   * Testable statements are falsified or confirmed
	   * Science, as represented by theoretical models, progresses incrementally
	 * Kuhn
	   * Researchers are socialized through education into paradigms
	   * Paradigms frame the set of models and puzzles
	   * Researchers explore and confirm models by solving puzzles (puzzles may be theoretical problems, or, more germanely, problems of engineering related to experiment design or measurement technology)
	   * Sometimes unrelated to puzzles, paradigms enter into periods of crisis
	   * Crisis is resolved by the defense of a paradigm or its replacement
  * For Popper, models are intrinsically linked to the definition of "a" science
    * "A" science proceeds, like a Markov Chain Monte Carlo experiment, through successive accept-reject modifications
  * For Kuhn, models are endogenously both generators and products of paradigms
    * Products, in that they act as educational devices and constrain the set of puzzles
	* Generators, in that they serve to anchor a new paradigm out of crisis
  * In both cases, they typically seek to:
    * Allow for a common understanding among a community of researchers
	* Provide a theoretical basis for descriptive and causal statements
	* Generate predictions about observable phenomena

## Epistemology and quadrants of knowledge
  * Day to day, science does not address concepts like "truth" and "knowledge"
  * However, epistemology can help us provide science (and perhaps our species as a whole) with a raison d'etre :
    * If we are inspired by realism, then science is the process by which we asymptotically approach "truth" or "reality," like the progress of Western art towards verisimilitude through technique, medium, and training 
	* If we are inspired by instrumentalism, then science is a tool that helps us induct our way to knowledge
  * We can simplify much of our discussion of knowledge by building a two-by-two grid:
    * Conditioned on a current "understanding," there are (very informally):
	  * Known knowns: "valid" statements that we explicitly take to be, either themselves or their negation, for all instances, "with probabilty one" or "without propensity otherwise."
	  * Unknown knowns: "valid" statements that may be either inferred from our current "understanding" or implicitly taken as known (above)
	  * Known unknowns: "valid" statements that we explicitly take to be, either for themselves or for their negation, for a given instance, not "with probability one" or "without propensity otherwise"
	  * Unknown unknowns: statements, sometimes valid but often invalid in our current "understanding," whose existence and/or propensity are not considered
    * Most of these words are imprecise; meant to be suggestive.
  * Let's take a simple example:
    * Suppose we are aliens who have landed near the equator on Earth.
	* In order to plan our activities, we decide to develop a model of precipitation.
	* During our time here, we've only experienced one kind of precipitation: rain.  Therefore, our model considers the simple Bernoulli event - rain or no rain.
	* The statement "It will rain tomorrow." is a **known unknown** in our frame of understanding and model.
	* Traveling slightly further from our equatorial base, we uncover an **unknown unknown**: snow.
	* In our original model of precipitation, we lacked a noun or outcome; note how closely related this idea is to Hume and the general problem of induction.	

## Why might we model today?
  * Read [Epstein (2008)](http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/12.html).
  * But to provide a more conceptual framework:
    * To deduce, to infer, or to predict, generating either certain or uncertain results.
	* To explore counterfactual, unobservable, or alternative deductions, inferences, or predictions.
    * To identify and explore the "derivatives" or factors of deductions, inferences, or predictions.
	* To communicate the result of deductions, inferences, or predictions.
  * In particular, we may use computational models because:
    * Discrete model concepts result in analytically intractable models.
	* Stochastic model concepts result in analytically intractable models.
	* Heterogenous model concepts result in analytically intractable models.
	* Interaction concepts result in analytically intractable models.
	* Derivatives in a model cannot be calculated analytically, often due to non-linearity.
	* Integrals in a model cannot be calculated analytically, often due to non-linearity.
	* Equilibria in a model cannot be calculated analytically.
